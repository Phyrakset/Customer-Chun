# Predicting Customer Churn using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using logistic regression. It was carried out as part of the 3rd-year Engineer's Degree in Data Science program at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia during  2022-2023.

## Project Overview

The project aims to analyze customer churn in a business context and develop a predictive model using logistic regression. The dataset used for this analysis consists of relevant customer information and churn status. By leveraging logistic regression, we aim to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn and build a model that can accurately predict churn behavior.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- `Predicting_customer_churn_using_logistic_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for predicting customer churn using logistic regression.
- `Report.pdf`: A report summarizing the project, including the problem statement, methodology, results, and conclusions.
- `dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluating the logistic regression model.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and repository contents.
